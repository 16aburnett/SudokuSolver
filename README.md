# SudokuSolver
By Amy Burnett

This Sudoku Game simulator is inspired by Cracking The Cryptic and their associated online Sudoku Game ([https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/](https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/)). There are simularities between my simulator and theirs because there are a lot of nice features that I wanted to capture as well. But the primary goal of this project is to experiment, explore, and ultimately build a Sudoku Solver which requires me to have a Sudoku simulator first. I am not an expert in Sudoku solving or advanced techniques so this project is meant to help me explore and get better at Sudokus and to see if I can leverage programming to solve Sudokus.
